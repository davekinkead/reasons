# Reasons.js

Reasons.js is a web based argument mapping tool built with HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.

Argument mapping has been shown to have significant positive effects on student reasoning abilities (van Gelder 2004) owing to the way “[p]ictures and structured diagrams are thought to be more comprehensible than just words, and a clearer way to illustrate understanding of complex topics.” (Davies 2011)


## Usage

  - Double click the canvas to add a reason
  - Drag one reason onto another to create a premise -> conclusion relation
  - Double click a reason or relation to edit their text
  - Select a reason or relation and press backspace to delete it
  - To create a compound relation between two premises:
  - First make sure that they support a common conclusion
  - Then drag one premise onto another
