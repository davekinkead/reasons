  <p>I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." I think the only card she has is the Lorem card.</p>

  <p>He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!</p>

  <div id="a" data-reasons-layout="inline"></div>

  <p>I know words. I have the best words. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.</p>

  <p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</p>

  <div id="b" data-reasons-layout="inline"></div>


  <p>Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.</p>

  <p>You’re disgusting. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.</p>
